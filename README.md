I use GitHub to store all my terrible mistakes.

In terms of me:
- My preferred language is C++, which is the best language in the world on every day of the week except those that end with *day*.  It is most certainly a very flexible language, although just because something bends doesn't mean you should keep bending it. Jokes aside, the language is powerful, general-purpose, has a mature ecosystem, lots of reference material, and is widely used - it'll allow you make whatever can think of.
- My other languages are C, TS/JS with React, Python, Java, and Rust, in order of experience.
    - The C comes with the C++ (although they're definitely *not* the same language). I use C++ where I can because RAII is wonderful for memory management, but sometimes C is unavoidable.
    - TypeScript and React I've used in a professional capacity, and I enjoy the simplicity of them.
    - Python I find incredibly useful for quick scripting, prototyping, and other automations
    - Java is fine. Just fine. It works, the ecosystem is very mature, and it's hard to mess up other than in the performance department.
    - Rust is what I'm currently learning because I imagine it's going to overtake C and C++ in a lot of areas within the next few years. I'd rather be ahead of the curve than right in the middle.
- I don't have any projects on at the moment because I'm focusing on learning Rust. The results of my learning may or may not end up here
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`.
- My favourite colour of paint is Valspar's Sleepy Kitten in Matte with 4000K lighting, which I'd strongly recommend getting the Premium Walls & Ceilings version of because you'll get away with only two coats as opposed to the Classic which can take more than three.
