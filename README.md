I use GitHub to store all my terrible mistakes.

In terms of me:
- My preferred language is C++, which is the best language in the world on every day of the week except those that end with *day*
- My other languages are C, Python, Java, and TS/JS in order of preference / experience
- My current major project is a multiplayer game, [MMORPG2](https://github.com/AlexGarrity/MMORPG2).  I also maintain a Minecraft modpack and am determined to find the most efficient way to mass-produce sandwiches
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`
