# Here be abandoned projects, explore at your own peril

## Languages
- My preferred language is [**Rust**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
- My other languages are **C++** / **C**, **F#**, **TS/JS** with **React** / **Remix**, and **Python** in order of experience.
    - The **C** and **C++** I have the most experience with and tend to treat as C with RAII / STL
    - **F#** I use profesionally and find nice enough, plus it has some fun party tricks
    - [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and **React** I also use professionally. I like using [**Remix**](https://github.com/remix-run) where I can as it makes the process much more enjoyable.
    - [**Python**](https://github.com/python/cpython) I use for quick scripting, prototyping, automations, and it's my go-to for data analysis.
 
## Other Cool Technologies
- I use [**Powershell**](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) for automations that are less processing-heavy - think basic command-line "applications" / tools.
- I use **Arch Linux** on my personal machines, and **Debian/Ubuntu** [LXCs](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/) on my homelab

## Extra Facts
- I'm almost always working on some sort of multiplayer game using Rust and [**Bevy**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`.
- My favourite colour of paint is Valspar's Sleepy Kitten in Matte with 3300K lighting, which I'd strongly recommend getting the Premium Walls & Ceilings version of because you'll get away with only two coats as opposed to the Classic which can take more than three.
