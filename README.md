I use GitHub to store all my terrible mistakes.

In terms of me:
- My preferred language is C++, on every day of the week except those that end with *day*
- My other languages are Python, Java, and TS/JS
- My current major project is a multiplayer game, [MMORPG2](https://github.com/AlexGarrity/MMORPG2)
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here

[I have a website with far more useful information on](https://agarrity.com)
