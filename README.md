I use GitHub to store all my terrible mistakes.

In terms of me:
- My preferred language at the moment is **Rust**, which I'm still exploring the use cases of. So far it's proving to be a very adequate replacement for **C** and **C++**, although I need more practice to fully grasp the semantics of it and how it works internally.
- My other languages are **C++**, **C**, **Python**, **TS/JS** with **React**, **Java**, and **F#**, in order of experience.
    - The **C** and **C++** go somewhat hand-in-hand (although they're definitely *not* the same language). I use C++ where I can because RAII is wonderful for memory management, as well as the fact that the STL exists, but sometimes C is unavoidable. I'm a better C++ programmer than a C programmer.
    - **TypeScript** and **React** I've used in a professional capacity, and I enjoy the simplicity of them.
    - **Python** I find incredibly useful for quick scripting, prototyping, and other automations
    - **Java** is fine. Just fine. It works, the ecosystem is very mature, and it's hard to mess up other than in the performance department.
    - **F#** I use profesionally, and is generally very nice to use once you get your head around thinking functionally (learning Rust first helped with that transition)
 
Other technologies I find cool:
    - I use **Powershell** a lot for automating simple processes or creating basic command-line "applications". The fact that it's basically just a C# interpreter makes it extremely easy to use but quite powerful
    - I'm currently having a look into **Docker** and **Containerisation**, as I want to learn more about microservices and how they can be leveraged in practical contexts. **Kubernetes** will probably be where I go next if this research looks promising
    - I primarily use **Arch Linux** on my personal machines, although I'm also pretty good with **Debian/Ubuntu** and **RHEL**

- Currently I'm working on an MMORPG in Rust as a learning exercise, which may at some point become a public repository
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`.
- My favourite colour of paint is Valspar's Sleepy Kitten in Matte with 4000K lighting, which I'd strongly recommend getting the Premium Walls & Ceilings version of because you'll get away with only two coats as opposed to the Classic which can take more than three.
