# Here be abandoned projects, explore at your own peril

## Languages
- My preferred language at the moment is **Rust**, which I'm still exploring the use cases of. So far it's proving to be a very adequate replacement for **C** and **C++**, although I need more practice to fully grasp the semantics of it and how it works internally.
- My other languages are **C++** / **C**, **F#**, **TS/JS** with **React** / **Next.js** / **Remix**, **Python**, and **Java**, in order of experience.
    - The **C** and **C++** go somewhat hand-in-hand (although they're definitely *not* the same language). I use C++ where I can because RAII is wonderful for memory management, as well as the fact that the STL exists, but sometimes C is unavoidable. Increasingly I'm finding that I prefer Rust's features, so we'll see how long this stays at the top of the list for.
    - **F#** I use profesionally, and is generally very nice to use once you get your head around thinking functionally (learning Rust first helped with that transition). There are a lot of very elegant ways to program that only work functionally.
    - **TypeScript** and **React** I've used in a professional capacity, and I enjoy the simplicity of them. Frameworks like **Next** and [**Remix**](https://github.com/remix-run) make the process much more enjoyable and handle boilerplate for you.
    - **Python** I find incredibly useful for quick scripting, prototyping, and other automations. It's also very much a go-to for quick data analysis, although I've heard that **F#** is pretty good for it too.
    - **Java** is fine. Just fine. It works, the ecosystem is very mature, and it's hard to mess up other than in the performance department.
 
## Other Cool Technologies
- I use **Powershell** a lot for automating simple processes or creating basic command-line "applications". The fact that it's basically just a .NET interpreter makes it extremely easy to use but quite powerful
- I primarily use **Arch Linux** on my personal machines, although I'm also pretty good with **Debian/Ubuntu** and **RHEL**
- I also do quite a bit of work using [**Selenium IDE**](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide) and [**Selenium WebDriver**](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium), which is great for testing websites, automating repetitive tasks, and, website-dependent, can also be used for load testing

## Extra Facts
- Currently I'm working on a remake of 2003's hottest railroad company simulation game - [Railroad Tycoon 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_3) - using Rust and [**Bevy**](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`.
- My favourite colour of paint is Valspar's Sleepy Kitten in Matte with 3300K lighting, which I'd strongly recommend getting the Premium Walls & Ceilings version of because you'll get away with only two coats as opposed to the Classic which can take more than three.
