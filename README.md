I use GitHub to store all my terrible mistakes.

In terms of me:
- My preferred language at the moment is Rust, which I'm still exploring the use cases of. So far it's proving to be a very adequate replacement for C and C++, although I need more practice to fully grasp the semantics of it and how it works internally.
- My other languages are C++, C, Python, TS/JS with React, Java, and F#, in order of experience.
    - The C comes with the C++ (although they're definitely *not* the same language). I use C++ where I can because RAII is wonderful for memory management, as well as the fact that the STL exists, but sometimes C is unavoidable.
    - TypeScript and React I've used in a professional capacity, and I enjoy the simplicity of them.
    - Python I find incredibly useful for quick scripting, prototyping, and other automations
    - Java is fine. Just fine. It works, the ecosystem is very mature, and it's hard to mess up other than in the performance department.
    - F# I use profesionally, and is generally very nice to use once you get your head around thinking functionally (learning Rust first helped with that transition)
- Currently I'm working on an MMORPG in Rust as a learning exercise, which may at some point become a public repository
- My favourite colour changes far too often for me to reliably put it here, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be ~`#4f424f`.
- My favourite colour of paint is Valspar's Sleepy Kitten in Matte with 4000K lighting, which I'd strongly recommend getting the Premium Walls & Ceilings version of because you'll get away with only two coats as opposed to the Classic which can take more than three.
